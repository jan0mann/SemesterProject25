**Semester Project - Group 15 - F25 - Heat Production Optimizer (HPO)**

Group members: Serafeim Karalis, Bartosz Jaworski, Noah Fabian Bokelmann, Mikolaj Piotr Ostrowski, Marcel Fedorovici and Jan Ferchof


Group supervisor: Dominik Wojciech Bosy

The **Heat Production Optimization** project is about calculating boiler distribution depending on different head demand in two scenarios (summer/winter). It aims to minimize costs for the heat production and works with an optimizer to do so. Regarding the architecture, an Asset Manager is created to store all necessary information about the boiler. The data, managed through the Source Data Manager, is imported as a CSV file into the program and uses the CSV helper library.

.. _additional info: the small percentage on shell usage is because of an icon issue for macOS. The solution for it was to implement some code written in Shell._
