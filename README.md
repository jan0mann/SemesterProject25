**Semester Project - Group 15 - F25 - Heat Production Optimizer (HPO)**

Group members: Serafeim Karalis, Bartosz Jaworski, Noah Fabian Bokelmann, Mikolaj Piotr Ostrowski, Marcel Fedorovici and Jan Ferchof
Group supervisor: Dominik Wojciech Bosy

The **Heat Production Optimization** project focuses on optimizing the scheduling of heat production units in a district heating network to minimize costs and improve efficiency. It integrates various components, including data management, optimization algorithms, and data visualization, to analyze heat demand and electricity prices for cost-effective operation. The project aims to develop a functional system that allows users to evaluate different production strategies and make informed decisions based on a dataset.
